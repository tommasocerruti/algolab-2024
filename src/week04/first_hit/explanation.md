#### Explanation
Extend the previous problem to find the first intersection of the ray with the segments. 
The key idea is, after the first hit, we check the intersection with the best segment instead of the original ray. 

Key Differences:
1. Use the Epec kernel since the operation is now a construction.
2. Randomize the input order to avoid performance issues from worst-case test cases.
3. Use CGAL::intersection() to find the intersection point or segment.  
4. To get a point of intersection: const P* op = boost::get<P>(&*o);
   If this is true, it is a point, else it is a segment.
5. To round down coordinates to the nearest integer, use a custom floor_to_double function and then cast to long.
