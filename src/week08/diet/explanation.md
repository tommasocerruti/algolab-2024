#### Explanation
Given:
1. n nutrients, each with minimum and maximum daily requirements.
2. m foods, each with a price and nutrient content.  
Determine the minimum cost of a diet that satisfies all constraints. If no diet exists, output "No such diet."

Approach:
For each nutrient two inequalities: i for max and i for min.
For each product we have a price for the cost function, and n values, one for each nutrient to put in the respective two inequalities.
Solve it and verify the solution.
